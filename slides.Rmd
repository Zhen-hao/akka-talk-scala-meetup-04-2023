- Concurrency and fault tolerance
- Event Sourcing

# High-level Overview (credit: chatGPT)

- Akka: An open-source toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems
- Based on the Actor model
- Implemented in Scala (and Java)
- Excellent for handling large-scale, stateful applications

---

# Actors

- Fundamental unit of computation in Akka

--

- Represent objects or entities in your system
--

- Encapsulate state and behavior

--

- Communicate exclusively through messages

--

- Single-threaded illusion

---

# Concurrency and Fault Tolerance

- Akka handles concurrency efficiently using message-passing

--

- Actors can be distributed across multiple nodes

--

- Location-transparent messaging enables scaling and fault tolerance

--

- Supervision and actor hierarchies support self-healing systems


---

# Event Sourcing

- Event Sourcing: State is a `foldLeft` of sequence of events

--

- Akka Persistence gives us event-sourced actors

--

- Persistent actors store events in an event journal

--

- Event journals can be used for recovery, replication, and historical analysis

--

- Supports various storage backends, such as Cassandra and PostgreSQL

# Why Akka is Irreplaceable at PairTime

- We want to use domain driven design and event sourcing

--

- We want fearless iteration (deploy to production at anytime)

--

- Without user disruption

--

- Akka enables zero-downtime rolling deployments:
  - Cluster sharding: Distribute actors across nodes
  - Location transparency: Actors can move between nodes seamlessly
  - Graceful shutdown: Migrate actors to other nodes before stopping a node
  - Gossip Protocol:  Fast failure detection

# How Akka Makes You a Better Engineer

- Learning displined OO

--

- Learning event sourcing

--

- Understanding resilience and fault tolerance

--

- Focussing on domain modeling 

--

- Applying Akka knowledge to other frameworks and languages

---

# Azure Durable Functions

```python
# Python example
import azure.functions as func
import azure.durable_functions as df


def entity_function(context: df.DurableEntityContext):
    current_value = context.get_state(lambda: 0)
    operation = context.operation_name
    if operation == "add":
        amount = context.get_input()
        current_value += amount
    elif operation == "reset":
        current_value = 0
    elif operation == "get":
        context.set_result(current_value)
    context.set_state(current_value)


main = df.Entity.create(entity_function)
```
